Flavours of Physics
----------------
Flavours of Physics was a machine learning competition, hosted by Kaggle and partly sponsed by CERN. The goal of the competition was to gain sensitivity in the search for τ → 3μ decays. My entry ranked 80 out of 673 teams on the private leaderboard. I will explain my methodology and discuss some random thoughts about the competition. 

τ → 3μ decays?
-------------------
It is a well known fact that [lepton flavor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavour_(particle_physics))(LF) numbers are strictly conserved in the Standard Model (SM). However, observations from certain neutrino experiments strongly suggests that there is some lepton
flavor mixing as well. What this means is that charged lepton flavor violating (cLFV) processes may also occur at some level.
Many current experiments are paying keen attention to the search for LFV processes in the charged lepton sector such as tau decays, Z → μτ decays, etc. LFV observed in experiments would be evidence of new physics beyond the SM.
